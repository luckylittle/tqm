# tqm

CLI tool to manage your torrent client queues. Primary focus is on removing torrents that meet specific criteria.

This is a fork from [l3uddz](https://github.com/l3uddz/tqm).

## Example Configuration

```yaml
clients:
  deluge:
    enabled: true
    filter: default
    download_path: /mnt/local/downloads/torrents/deluge
    free_space_path: /mnt/local/downloads/torrents/deluge # Required for Deluge with path that exists on server
    download_path_mapping:
      /downloads/torrents/deluge: /mnt/local/downloads/torrents/deluge
    host: localhost
    login: localclient
    password: password-from-/opt/deluge/auth
    port: 58846
    type: deluge
    v2: true
  qbt:
    download_path: /mnt/local/downloads/torrents/qbittorrent/completed
    # free_space_path is not needed for qBittorrent as it checks globally via API
    download_path_mapping:
      /downloads/torrents/qbittorrent/completed: /mnt/local/downloads/torrents/qbittorrent/completed
    enabled: true

    user: user
    password: password
    # NEW: If this option is set to true, AutoTmm aka Auto Torrent Managment Mode,
    # will be enabled for torrents after a relabel.
    # This ensures the torrent is also moved in the filesystem to the new category path, and not only changes category in qbit
    # enableAutoTmmAfterRelabel: true
notifications:
  # if detailed is true, TQM will send detailed information about each action it takes
  # if it is false it will only send a summary notification

        # NOTE: Mode does not change the way torrents are flagged,
        # meaning, even with "mode: remove",
        # tags will be removed if the torrent does NOT match the conditions.
        # "mode: remove" simply means that tags will not be added
        # to torrents that do match.

      ignore_paths:
        - /mnt/local/downloads/torrents/qbittorrent/completed/tv-4k
        - /mnt/local/downloads/torrents/qbittorrent/completed/movie-4k

## Optional - Tracker Configuration

trackers:
  bhd:
    api_key: your-api-key
  btn:
    api_key: your-api-key
  ptp:
    api_user: your-api-user
    api_key: your-api-key
  hdb:
    username: your-username
    passkey: your-passkey
  red:
    api_key: your-api-key
  ops:
    api_key: your-api-key
  unit3d:
    aither:
      api_key: your_api_key
      domain: aither.cc
    blutopia:
      api_key: your_api_key
      domain: blutopia.cc
```

Allows tqm to validate if a torrent was removed from the tracker using the tracker's own API.

Currently implements:

- Beyond-HD
- BTN
- HDB
- OPS
- PTP
- RED
- UNIT3D trackers

**Note for BTN users**: When first using the BTN API, you may need to authorize your IP address. Check your BTN notices/messages for the authorization request.

## Filtering Language Definition

The language definition used in the configuration filters is available [here](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/586b86b462d22497d442adbc924bfb701db3075d/docs/Language-Definition.md)

## Filterable Fields

The following torrent fields (along with their types) can be used in the configuration when filtering torrents:

```go
type Torrent struct {
 Hash                 string
 Name                 string
 Path                 string
 TotalBytes           int64
 DownloadedBytes      int64
 State                string
 Files                []string
 Tags                 []string
 Downloaded           bool
 Seeding              bool
 Ratio                float32
 AddedSeconds         int64
 AddedHours           float32
 AddedDays            float32
 SeedingSeconds       int64
 SeedingHours         float32
 SeedingDays          float32
 LastActivitySeconds  int64
 LastActivityHours    float32
 LastActivityDays     float32
 Label                string
 Seeds                int64
 Peers                int64
 IsPrivate            bool
 IsPublic             bool

 FreeSpaceGB  func() float64
 FreeSpaceSet bool

 TrackerName   string
 TrackerStatus string
}
```

Number fields of types `int64`, `float32` and `float64` support [arithmetic](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/586b86b462d22497d442adbc924bfb701db3075d/docs/Language-Definition.md#arithmetic-operators) and [comparison](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/586b86b462d22497d442adbc924bfb701db3075d/docs/Language-Definition.md#comparison-operators) operators.

Fields of type `string` support [string operators](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/586b86b462d22497d442adbc924bfb701db3075d/docs/Language-Definition.md#string-operators).

Fields of type `[]string` (lists) such as the `Tags` and `Files` fields support [membership checks](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/586b86b462d22497d442adbc924bfb701db3075d/docs/Language-Definition.md#membership-operators) and various [built in functions](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/586b86b462d22497d442adbc924bfb701db3075d/docs/Language-Definition.md#builtin-functions).

All of this and more can be noted in the [language definition](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/586b86b462d22497d442adbc924bfb701db3075d/docs/Language-Definition.md) mentioned above.

## Helper Filtering Options

The following helper functions are available for usage while filtering, usage examples are available in the example config above.

```go
IsUnregistered() bool     // Evaluates to true if torrent is unregistered in the tracker
IsTrackerDown() bool      // Evaluates to true if the tracker appears to be down/unreachable
HasAllTags(tags ...string) bool // True if torrent has ALL tags specified
HasAnyTag(tags ...string) bool  // True if torrent has at least one tag specified
HasMissingFiles() bool // True if any of the torrent's files are missing from disk
Log(n float64) float64    // The natural logarithm function
```

### Filtering by Private/Public Status

You can use either `IsPublic` or `IsPrivate` to filter torrents - they are complementary fields. Always use explicit comparisons (`== true` or `== false`).

Example filters:

```yaml
filters:
  default:
    ignore:
      # These achieve the same result:
      - IsPublic == false && !IsUnregistered() # private torrents
      - IsPrivate == true && !IsUnregistered() # private torrents
    remove:
      # These achieve the same result:
      - IsPublic == true && Ratio > 2.0 # public torrents
      - IsPrivate == false && Ratio > 2.0 # public torrents
    tag:
      - name: public-torrent
        mode: full
        update:
          # These achieve the same result:
          - IsPublic == true # public torrents
          - IsPrivate == false # public torrents
```

### Conditional Upload Speed Limiting via Tags

You can apply upload speed limits to torrents conditionally based on matching `tag` rules. This is useful for throttling specific groups of torrents (e.g., public torrents).

- Add an optional `uploadKb` field to any rule within the `tag:` section of your filter definition.
- The value should be the desired upload speed limit in **KiB/s**.
- Use `-1` to signify an unlimited upload speed. `500` for 500Kb.
- If a torrent matches the `update:` conditions for a tag rule that includes `uploadKb`, the specified speed limit will be applied to that torrent.
- This speed limit is applied when you run the `tqm retag <client>` command.

Example:

```yaml
filters:
  default:
    tag:
      # Tag public torrents AND limit their upload speed to 50 KiB/s
      - name: public
        mode: add
        uploadKb: 50
        update:
          - IsPrivate == false

      # Tag private torrents AND remove any upload speed limit
      - name: private
        mode: add
        uploadKb: -1
        update:
          - IsPrivate == true
```

### MapHardlinksFor

Within each filter definition in your `config.yaml`, you can optionally include the `MapHardlinksFor` setting. This setting controls when tqm performs the (potentially time-consuming) process of scanning torrent files to identify hardlinks.

```yaml
filters:
  default:
    MapHardlinksFor:
      - clean
    ignore:
      - Downloaded == false
      - IsTrackerDown()
      - HardlinkedOutsideClient == true && !isUnregistered() # this makes sure we never remove torrents that has a hardlink (unless they are unregistered)
```

:warning: To prevent potential data corruption or incomplete moves when TMM is used, relabeling of cross-seeded torrents only happens when ALL torrents of the same group (share the same underlying data) match the criteria (e.g. `SeedingDays >= 7.0`)

**Recommendation:**

- Include a command name in `MapHardlinksFor` only if your filter rules for that specific command use the `HardlinkedOutsideClient` field.
- If none of your filter rules use `HardlinkedOutsideClient`, you can omit the `MapHardlinksFor` setting entirely for better performance.

### IsUnregistered and IsTrackerDown

When using both `IsUnregistered()` and `IsTrackerDown()` in filters:

- `IsUnregistered()` has built-in protection against tracker down states - it will return `false` if the tracker is down
- `IsTrackerDown()` checks if the tracker status indicates the tracker is unreachable/down
- The functions are independent but related - a torrent can be:
  - Unregistered with tracker up (IsUnregistered: true, IsTrackerDown: false)
  - Status unknown with tracker down (IsUnregistered: false, IsTrackerDown: true)
  - Registered with tracker up (IsUnregistered: false, IsTrackerDown: false)

Note: While `IsUnregistered()` automatically handles tracker down states, you may still want to explicitly check for `IsTrackerDown()` in your ignore filters to prevent any actions when tracker status is uncertain.

#### Customizing Unregistered Statuses (Per-Tracker)

By default, `IsUnregistered()` checks against a built-in list of common status messages that indicate a torrent is no longer registered with the tracker (e.g., `"torrent not found"`, `"unregistered torrent"`).

You can override this default list **on a per-tracker basis** by defining specific lists in the configuration file under the `tracker_errors` section. This allows you to tailor the detection to the unique messages used by different trackers.

Example `config.yaml` snippet:

```yaml
tracker_errors:
  # Override the default list of unregistered statuses on a per-tracker basis.
  # If a tracker is listed here, ONLY the statuses provided for it will be used for matching against its torrents (and statuses returned by tracker APIs).
  # If a tracker is NOT listed, the internal default list will be used for its torrents.
  # Matching is exact and case-insensitive. Tracker names are also case-insensitive.
  per_tracker_unregistered_statuses:
    "passthepopcorn.me":
      - "torrent not found"
      - "unregistered torrent"
    "torrentleech.org":
      - "unregistered torrent"
```

**Key Points:**

- If a specific tracker is defined under `per_tracker_unregistered_statuses`, the list provided for it **replaces** the default list for torrents associated with that tracker.
- If a tracker is _not_ listed under `per_tracker_unregistered_statuses`, the default built-in list of statuses will be used for its torrents.
- Matching against these lists is **exact** and **case-insensitive** (both for the status messages and the tracker names).
- The check against tracker APIs (if configured for a specific tracker, e.g., PTP, BTN) still happens regardless of the status message matching.

Example:

```yaml
filters:
  default:
    ignore:
      - IsTrackerDown() # Skip any actions when tracker is down
    remove:
      - IsUnregistered() # Safe to use alone due to built-in protection
```

## BypassIgnoreIfUnregistered

If the top level config option `bypassIgnoreIfUnregistered` is set to `true`, unregistered torrents will not be ignored.
This helps making the config less verbose, so this:

```yaml
filters:
  default:
    ignore:
      # general
      - IsTrackerDown()
      - Downloaded == false && !IsUnregistered()
      - SeedingHours < 26 && !IsUnregistered()
      - HardlinkedOutsideClient == true && !IsUnregistered()
      # permaseed / un-sorted (unless torrent has been deleted)
      - Label startsWith "permaseed-" && !IsUnregistered()
      # Filter based on qbittorrent tags (only qbit at the moment)
      - '"permaseed" in Tags && !IsUnregistered()'
```

can turn into this:

```yaml
bypassIgnoreIfUnregistered: true

filters:
  default:
    ignore:
      # general
      - IsTrackerDown()
      - Downloaded == false
      - SeedingHours < 26
      - HardlinkedOutsideClient == true
      # permaseed / un-sorted (unless torrent has been deleted)
      - Label startsWith "permaseed-"
      # Filter based on qbittorrent tags (only qbit at the moment)
      - "permaseed" in Tags
```

## Supported Clients

- Deluge
- qBittorrent

## Example Commands

1. Clean - Retrieve torrent client queue and remove torrents matching its configured filters

`tqm clean qbt --dry-run`

`tqm clean qbt`

2. Relabel - Retrieve torrent client queue and relabel torrents matching its configured filters

`tqm relabel qbt --dry-run`

`tqm relabel qbt`

`tqm relabel qbt -v --experimental-relabel` - Enable experimental relabeling for cross-seeded torrents, using hardlinks (only qbit for now)

3. Retag - Retrieve torrent client queue and retag torrents matching its configured filters (only qbittorrent supported as of now)

`tqm retag qbt --dry-run`

`tqm retag qbt`

4. Orphan - Retrieve torrent client queue and local files/folders in download_path, remove orphan files/folders. Files modified within the grace period (default: 10m) will be skipped.

`tqm orphan qbt --dry-run`

`tqm orphan qbt`

5. Pause - Retrieve torrent client queue and pause torrents matching its configured filters

`tqm pause qbt --dry-run`

`tqm pause qbt`

---

## Notes

### Free Space Tracking

`FreeSpaceSet` and `FreeSpaceGB()` are available for tracking free disk space in your filters. These allow you to make decisions based on available disk space and track space changes as torrents are removed.

#### Availability

- For **Deluge**, `free_space_path` must be set and point to a valid path on your server
- For **qBittorrent**, the `free_space_path` parameter is not needed and can be omitted

#### How It Works

1. Free space information is retrieved when a command is run
2. If successful, `FreeSpaceSet` becomes `true` and `FreeSpaceGB()` will return the available space in gigabytes

#### Using in Filters

You can use these values in your filter expressions:

```yaml
filters:
  default:
    remove:
      - FreeSpaceSet == true && FreeSpaceGB() < 100 && SeedingDays > 30
```

## regexp2 Pattern Matching

TQM uses the regexp2 library for advanced pattern matching, providing .NET style regex capabilities. This offers several advantages over Go's standard regex package:

- More powerful pattern matching features
- Compatibility with .NET style regex patterns
- Reliable Unicode support

### Available Functions

```yaml
filters:
  default:
    tag:
      # Single pattern matching
      - RegexMatch("(?i)\\bpattern\\b")

      # Match any of multiple patterns (comma-separated)
      - RegexMatchAny("(?i)\\bpattern1\\b, (?i)\\bpattern2\\b")

      # Match all patterns (comma-separated)
      - RegexMatchAll("(?i)\\bpattern1\\b, (?i)\\bpattern2\\b")
```

### Pattern Features

- Case insensitive matching with `(?i)`
- Word boundaries with `\b`
- Lookahead assertions:
  - Positive `(?=...)`
  - Negative `(?!...)`
- Lookbehind assertions:
  - Positive `(?<=...)`
  - Negative `(?<!...)`
- Unicode support
- Timeout support for preventing catastrophic backtracking

### Tips

- Each pattern can have its own case sensitivity flag:

  ```yaml
  # First pattern is case-insensitive, second is case-sensitive
  - RegexMatchAny("(?i)pattern1, pattern2")

  # Both patterns are case-insensitive
  - RegexMatchAny("(?i)pattern1, (?i)pattern2")
  ```

- Patterns are comma-separated
- Use word boundaries to prevent partial matches
- Lookbehind assertions must be fixed-width
